# ARP-Weekly-Challenges
This repository contains all members' solutions to the Alteryx Weekly Challenges in R and Python. It is designed to help participants get better at writing R and/or Python code.

This project was started on 2018-08-28 and the aim is to complete a challenge every week. Doing them at your own pace is also fine.
We hope to go through some of the solutions on Python Mondays.

The current members are:
- Philip Mannering
- Alex Jones
- David Sanchez Martin

The top 10 solved are:
